<h1>Scripts that I use for my Arch Linux machine</h1>

<h2>This currently includes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>A script for dwm (dynamic window manager by suckless) that creates a status bar with relevant information for me using `xsetroot -name` command.
I have the color patch for dwm status bar installed, so this won't work without the patch (or the color stuff can just be removed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>I write my scripts so that they affirm to POSIX and I use dash as my script interpreter</h3>
